        //Explain why variable names like 1stVariable, total-amount, and class are invalid in Java:

        // In Java, variable names must follow specific rules and conventions to be considered valid.
        // The variable names 1stVariable, total-amount,
        // and class are invalid because they violate these rules.
        //  1stVariable ==> Reason for Invalidity: Starts with a number.
        // total-amount ==> Reason for Invalidity: Contains a hyphen (-).
        // class ==> Reason for Invalidity: class is a reserved keyword in Java.
